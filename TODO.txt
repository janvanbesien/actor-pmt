- add something like accumulated volume providers (w/o cache!)
- repository idea also for providers?
- try to get some real performance measurements into it (and look at run time threading behavior with yourkit) -> make metricproviderscanner abstract and provide an implementation which reads lots of data (from csv or in memory?) and make sure the monitors actually have some work calculating the metrics...
- add real metric calculation based on actual formula's (parser/combinator?) or simply hard coded in metric definition
- read real metrics.xml or use a custom DSL ?
- use akka and experiment with an implementation in Java... might be necessary to get this prototype accepted or real?
- do I need to build some kind of "recovery" into the providers, in case the pmt was down for a while?
- do I need to foresee something to check if a provider sends a message that it also gets processed (using !! and futures?)? Do I need to retry if it doesn't?
- try to make prototype of a "on demand metric generation" kind of use case
- dependency injection (cake pattern?)
- logging
- configuration with some scala config library
