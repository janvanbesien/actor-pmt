- add something like accumulated volume providers (w/o cache!)
- repository idea also for providers?
- try to get some real performance measurements into it (and look at run time threading behavior with yourkit)
- add real metric calculation based on actual formula's (parser/combinator?) or simply hard coded in metric definition
- read real metrics.xml or use a custom DSL ?
