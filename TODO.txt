- add something like accumulated volume providers (w/o cache!)
- add tests to test availability of metrics and to prototype that testing will be much easier now
- repository idea
- cleanup of old metrics in the received metrics collection after some time
- add test to show that separate recovery mechanism is no longer necessary
- try to get some real performance measurements into it
