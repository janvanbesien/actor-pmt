- add something like accumulated volume providers (w/o cache!)
- add tests to test availability of metrics and to prototype that testing will be much easier now
- repository idea also for providers?
- cleanup of old metrics in the received metrics collection after some time
- add test to show that separate recovery mechanism is no longer necessary
- try to get some real performance measurements into it (and look at run time threading behavior with yourkit)
- add real metric calculation based on actual formula's (parser/combinator?) or simply hard coded in metric definition
